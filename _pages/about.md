My name is Hossein Soltanloo, and I got my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2021.

My main research interests are software engineering, operating systems, distributed systems, and human-computer interactions. My B.Sc. thesis also focused on developing a simulator for the `Hybrid Rebeca` language--an actor-based cyber-physical system modeling language. I used to do my B.Sc. thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Fatemeh Ghassemi](http://www.fatemehghassemi.ir/).

Moreover, I have two years of experience in Front-End Software Engineering. I have worked with various tools and technologies to deliver the best client-side experience. I used to work at [Tapsell](https://tapsell.ir/en/), the most reputable network in the digital advertising industry in Iran. Before my role at Tapsell, I worked at [HerminaTech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/herminatech/), where I also did my B.Sc. internship focusing on developing a web-based property management system.
